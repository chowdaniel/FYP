Fitting replicating portfolio using output from Autoencoder

The file "Portfolio.csv" is a sorted list of stocks from lowest SSE to highest SSE

"RP.py" fit the Replicating Portfolio using a Neural Network and Linear Regression and calculates the SSE of the fit

"Linear_Plot.py" plots the cumulative returns of the Replicating Portfolios fitted using Linear Regression on the sample and validation set
